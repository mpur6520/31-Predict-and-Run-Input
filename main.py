#Task 1 - Add comments to the code below to predict what will happen when it is run.

#Task 2 - add comments to the code to explain what the variable(s) are called and where they are used. Make sure to show where the variable.

print("Hi! What's your name?") #print the string "Hi! What's your name?" for user to see

#creates variable called name
name = input() #variable name used to store input from the user; allows user to input word

#variable name is used - holds user input as a string - connected to other string written in parentheses to form one output line
print("Hi " + name + "! How are you today?") 
#print the string "Hi [name]! How are you today?" with [name] being substituted for the user's input from line 7
